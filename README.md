# Bugger

## Installation / Getting Started

```
git clone git@github.com:katherinebeam/bugger.git
cd bugger
open index.html
```

## How to Play

The goal is to get your player from the bottom of the screen to the water at the top of the screen without running into any of the enemies (the bugs). Use the arrow keys to move your player left, right, up, and down the screen.

## Learning Purpose

I completed this project as part of the Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree. The purpose of this project was to use Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) to build a functional arcade-style game that can be played in the browser.
